##MikeRSS

MikeRSS is a rss reader that is simple, clean and quick to use.

## Motivation

I created this program when looking for a simple rss reader for windows, but there were very few options
out there and there were features on them that I didnt really use so I decided to create my own. That was about 
4 months ago and since then I have used it constantly and thought of some improvments that could be made to the
application. Since version 1 was made in winforms and I didnt have much experience in WPF the decision was made
to port the whole application across to WPF and make the changes at the same time so I could learn a few things
along the way.

## Installation
you can either open it in visual studio or download the release
